# SimonSays.Py
My very first working python game I have made. Graphics drawn using graphics.py.

## Beeping will only work on Windows, might crash if ran in Mac.
I use the library 'winsound' from Windows in order to make the beeps in the game. I am not sure if it still runs without the beeping on any other operating system.

## Place all files inside a folder and run SimonSays.exe
First time I compile a program into an executable, I hope when downloaded it runs fine on another PC.
