# SimonSays.Py
My very first functional python game I have made. Graphics drawn using graphics.py.

## Beeping will only work on Windows Operating Systems, program may crash if it is ran in a Mac or Linux, etc.
I use the library 'winsound' from Windows in order to make the beeps in the game. I am not sure if it still runs without the beeping on any other operating system.
